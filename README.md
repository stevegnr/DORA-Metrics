#DORA-Metrics

"Through six years of research, the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) team has identified four key metrics that indicate the performance of a software development team: 

- Deployment Frequency—How often an organization successfully releases to production

- Lead Time for Changes—The amount of time it takes a commit to get into production

- Change Failure Rate—The percentage of deployments causing a failure in production

- Time to Restore Service—How long it takes an organization to recover from a failure in production"
